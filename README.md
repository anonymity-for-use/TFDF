# Code for Learning transferable and discriminative features for unsupervised domain adaptation

# Code and data
This is the code for TFDF implemented by MATLAB! The source code is the "src" folder and the data is in the "data" folder

# Run code
you can cd /src/experiments, then you can run the demo code

when train_mode = 'init', you will run the TFDF-V algorithm, after that, setting mode = 'adam', then you can run TFDF algorithm!
